======================
Personal configuration
======================

This directory holds a set of configuration files
for individual users and specific devices.

This area is intended to help support the
ability to reproduce the working environment
of individual team members - either to recover
from a catastrophic failure or to reproduce
and diagnose problems.

This area was created because Eclipse
configuration can affect the behaviour of the
build but is at the same time both user and
machine specific, making it unsuitable to store
in the main part of the repository.
